Retention operations for the garmin-health-data SQLite database.

Public entry points:

- :func:`migrate_cascade` retrofits ``ON DELETE CASCADE`` onto the 16 child foreign
  keys that were declared without an explicit FK action in older versions of
  ``tables.ddl``. SQLite has no ``ALTER TABLE`` mechanism for changing FK actions,
  so each affected child table is rebuilt via the standard recreate dance.
- :func:`prune_ts_metrics` deletes rows from ``activity_ts_metric`` whose parent
  activity ``start_ts`` falls in a half-open ``[start, end)`` range matching the
  ``extract`` command's date conventions (with the same-day special case).
- :func:`downsample_activities` aggregates ``activity_ts_metric`` rows into
  per-bucket records in ``activity_ts_metric_downsampled``, with activity-level
  replace semantics (target activities have their existing downsampled rows wiped
  and rewritten in a single transaction; activities with no source rows are
  excluded from the replace set so their pre-existing buckets are preserved).
