"""
Filesystem lifecycle helpers for the four-folder extract/process pipeline.

The pipeline maintains a `garmin_files/` directory next to the SQLite database
with four subdirectories that represent file state:

- ingest/    Newly extracted files awaiting processing.
- process/   Files currently being processed (in-flight).
- storage/   Files successfully loaded into the database (kept as backup).
- quarantine/ Files that failed processing (kept for inspection).

This mirrors the openetl pipeline pattern. State transitions are filesystem
moves; a crashed run leaves files in process/, which the next run recovers
back to ingest/ before continuing.
