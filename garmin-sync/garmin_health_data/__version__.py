"""
Version information for garmin-health-data.

Single source of truth: ``[project].version`` in ``pyproject.toml``. Read back at
runtime via ``importlib.metadata`` so the value can never drift from what was packaged
into the installed distribution.

Falls back to a clearly-broken sentinel when the package isn't installed (e.g. a source
checkout run without ``pip install -e .``), making the "version unknown" case obvious
instead of silently reporting a stale literal.
