        Extract a RANGE-typed Garmin data type with a single API call covering the
        full window, instead of one call per day.

        The Garmin endpoints behind RANGE-typed wrappers each accept a native date
        range and return all matching rows in one response (the wrappers paginate
        internally where the endpoint imposes a max range, e.g. menstrual cycle
        calendar's 92-day chunk). Calling them once per day with ``start = end``
        wastes API quota, multiplies disk I/O, and (for the menstrual cycle summary
        path) re-fires the wipe-and-replace policy per file when one pass would
        suffice.

        After the single API call, the response is either:

        - **Split per day** for data types whose rows are naturally per-day
          (``BODY_COMPOSITION``, ``ACTIVITIES_LIST``; see ``_PER_DAY_SPLITTERS``).
          Each day with rows lands in its own file, preserving the per-day
          ``(user, day)`` FileSet abstraction the processor expects. Days with no
          rows write no file.
        - **Written as a single file stamped ``end_date``** for data types whose
          rows are per-range / per-cycle and need to be processed atomically
          (``MENSTRUAL_CYCLE_SUMMARY``: its wipe-and-replace policy for predicted
          cycles must see the full new set of cycles in one transaction, so
          splitting would re-introduce the redundant-write bug).
